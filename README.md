# Minesweeper-GA aka ShakAttack's Mine Field
Web browser game replicating Minesweeper. 

The objective of minesweeper is to avoid the bombs hidden within a board of cells. If you clear the game you win, if you choose a bomb you lose. When a clear cell is chosed, a number will be rendered indicating how many bombs are surrounding it, in order to give you a better prediction of where the bombs might be located.

Next Steps:
1. Fix the function for clearing multiple squares at a time
2. Make options for multiple board sizes (easy, medium, hard levels)
